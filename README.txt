Description of elements.
================================

BEDOPS_Test_Final: 
    * Created to experiment and check how BEDOPS works.
    * Code results implemented in the main Leishmania Project.

BEDOPS_join_strands:
    * Problem: the 6k elements are in both strands and sometimes are overlaped.
    * Need to remove the overlaps in that way.
